        <h2>A classic recipe for sugar cookies!</h2>
        <h3><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>I1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional)</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Additional granulated sugar for rolling</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><strong>STEPS</strong></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. You can use an electric mixer or do this by hand with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract (if using), until well combined.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until the dough comes together. You can use a mixer on low speed or continue mixing by hand.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into two equal parts. Wrap each portion in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until the dough is firm.</li>
            <li>Take one portion of the dough out of the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes from the dough. Place the cut-out cookies onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with a little bit of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are just starting to turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 7-11 with the remaining dough.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2><strong>Once the cookies are completely cooled, you can decorate them with icing, frosting, or sprinkles, if desired. Enjoy your homemade sugar cookies!</strong></h2>
