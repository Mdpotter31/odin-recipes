          <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Cook the elbow macaroni according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or pot, cook the ground beef over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through. Break it up into crumbles as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Add the diced onion, minced garlic, and diced bell pepper (if using) to the skillet with the ground beef. Saut√© for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes (with their juices) and the rinsed and drained kidney beans. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the chili mixture simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. If the mixture becomes too thick, you can add a little water or beef broth to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked elbow macaroni to the skillet or pot with the chili mixture. Stir everything together until well combined and heated through.</li>
            <li>Serve the Chili Mac hot in bowls. Optionally, top each serving with shredded cheese, chopped green onions, or a dollop of sour cream for added flavor and creaminess.</li>
          </ol>
